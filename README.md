# Atta: A Slack-API Events ingestor to store evidence of your best work from Slack. 
Currently, the app is:
- Catching a call emitted from Slack's API
- Publicizing my localhost through nGrok
- Catching those calls using an endpoint built in Flask 
- Mutating the received data to fit a newly created table in PostgreSQL 
- Displaying that table on a static HTML page, accessible through an nGrok endpoint.
