# webhook-receive-respond-test
Testing basic functionality of:
- Catching a call emitted from Slack's API
- Publicizing my localhost through nGrok
- Catching those calls using an endpoint built in Flask 
- Mutating the received data to fit a newly created table in PostgreSQL 
- Displaying that table on a static HTML page, accessible through an nGrok endpoint.
